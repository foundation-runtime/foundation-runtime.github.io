{"name":"Foundation-runtime.github.io","tagline":"","body":"Foundation Runtime is a set of modules that we designed at Cisco for server applications. We thought they could be helpful to the broader community so we open sourced them. The modules stand by themselves, but are most helpful when used together to provide a holistic solution to standard needs of enterprise server systems.\r\nThe main modules are:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Common Configuration\r\n* Communication API - this includes HTTP client and Server, Async Messaging\r\n* Logging (including structured logging)\r\n* Service Discovery infrastructure\r\n* Monitoring\r\n* Other goodies\r\n\r\n\r\nThere’s nothing new in an HTTP client module or a logging library; the point is that these disparate areas of plumbing are integrated together using best of breed 3rd party open source software (Apache HttpClient, SLF4J, Jetty Server - to name a few) with the following powerful advantages:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Smart defaults\r\n* Client side load balancing\r\n* Structured logging\r\n* Automatic correlation ids in log files to assist tracking a single transaction from different processes' logs\r\n* Asynchronous Messaging\r\n* Integrated Service Directory\r\n* Central Configuration\r\n\r\nMore info in the detailed wikis. And we’ll answer questions too.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
