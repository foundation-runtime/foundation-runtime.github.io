{"name":"Foundation-runtime.github.io","tagline":"","body":"Foundation Runtime is a set of modules that we designed at Cisco for server applications. We thought they could be helpful to the broader community so we open sourced them. The modules stand by themselves, but are most helpful when used together to provide a holistic solution to standard needs of enterprise server systems.\r\nThe mail modules are:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Common Configuration\r\n* Communication API - this includes HTTP client and Server, Async Messaging\r\n* Logging (including structured logging)\r\n* Service Discovery infrastructure\r\n* Monitoring\r\n* Other goodies\r\n\r\n\r\nThereâ€™s nothing new in an HTTP client module or a logging library; the point over here is that these disparate areas of plumbing are integrated together using best of breed 3rd party open source software (Apache HttpClient, SLF4J, Jetty Server - to name a few) with the following humble yet powerful advantages:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Smart defaults\r\n* Client side load balancing\r\n* Structured logging\r\n* Automatic correlation ids in log files to assist tracking a single transaction from different processes' logs\r\n* Async Messaging\r\n* Service Directory\r\n* Central Configuration\r\n\r\n\r\nNaturally there's more to it, so why don't you pick a repository of your choice and dive into some of the wikis? \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
