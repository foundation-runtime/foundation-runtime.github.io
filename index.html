      	Foundation Runtime is a set of modules that we designed at Cisco for server applications. We thought they could be helpful to the broader community so we open sourced them. The modules stand by themselves, but are most helpful when used together to provide a holistic solution to standard needs of enterprise server systems.
The mail modules are:
•	Common Configuration
•	Communication API - this includes HTTP client and Server, Async Messaging
•	Logging (including structured logging)
•	Service Discovery infrastructure
•	Monitoring
•	Other goodies
There’s nothing new in an HTTP client module or a logging library; the point over here is that these disparate areas of plumbing are integrated together using best of breed 3rd party open source software (Apache HttpClient, SLF4J, Jetty Server - to name a few) with the following humble yet powerful advantages:
•	Smart defaults
•	Client side load balancing
•	Structured logging
•	Automatic correlation ids in log files to assist tracking a single transaction from different processes' logs
•	Async Messaging
•	Service Directory
•	Central Configuration
Naturally there's more to it, so why don't you pick a repository of your choice and dive into some of the wikis? 

      	
      	
        <p>Foundation Runtime is a set of modules that all work together and aim to supply basic functionality in these areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Common Configuration</li>
<li>Communication API - this includes HTTP client and Server, Async Messaging</li>
<li>Monitoring</li>
<li>Other goodies</li>
</ul>
      

    <p>So - what's the big deal? Many http client and server libraries are out there. Many monitoring solutions and configuration solutions exist.
      </br>This is all correct and true. However - how many of these know how to successfully interact with each other?
      </br>Foundation Runtime introduces a means to use state of the art 3rd parties 
      (Apache HttpClient, Apache Commons Configuration, Jetty Server - to name a few) 
      and wrap them with short and concise code that:
      <ul>
<li>Applies smart defaults</li>
<li>Supplies client side load balancing</li>
<li>Common logging pattern with logged correlation ids that assist in tracking a single transaction from different processes' logs</li>
<li>Async Messaging</li>
</ul>
    </p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>Naturally there's more to it, so why don't you pick a repository of your choice and dive into some of the wikis? You can find a button on top of this page to find our repositories.</p>
